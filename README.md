# AI Agents

A repository dedicated to AI agents, their architectures, implementations, and applications.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They combine various AI technologies such as:

- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Planning and Reasoning
- Tool Usage

## Types of AI Agents

### 1. Simple Reflex Agents
- Act based on current percepts only
- Ignore history
- Implement condition-action rules

### 2. Model-Based Reflex Agents
- Maintain internal state to track aspects of the world
- Update state based on percept history
- Choose actions based on current state

### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Work towards specific goals
- Consider future actions and their outcomes
- Plan sequences of actions to achieve goals

### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Maximize expected utility
- Consider preferences among different goal states
- Balance competing goals

### 5. Learning Agents
- Improve performance over time through experience
- Adapt to changing environments
- Learn from feedback

## Modern AI Agent Frameworks

- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **AutoGPT**: Autonomous GPT-4 based agent that chains together LLM calls
- **BabyAGI**: Task-driven autonomous agent using LLMs
- **AgentGPT**: Browser-based autonomous AI agents
- **JARVIS**: Framework for flexible and modular agent creation

## Applications
